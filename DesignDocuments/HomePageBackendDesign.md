# Homepage Backend (i.e. index)
The Homepage Backend (index) should have a link to the Fight Selection Page.
It should also interface with the database in order to get the Daily fight results.
It should select the rows from the "Fighters" table to get the wikipedia images for the daily fight.
The Homepage will also have access to a module for accessing the Wikipedia API so that it can load wiki pages.
And finally it should select the 10 most recent non-daily fights in order to show recent global fights.
