# Design "Fight" results page frontend
The fight results will actually be an alert as opposed to a page itself. It will appear like a “Wordle” with an overlay appearing when the fight concludes and with an “x” button that you can close the overlay with. It should indicate the winner in a fancy font. And it should also indicate the defeated party.
